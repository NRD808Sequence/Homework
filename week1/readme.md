*Create a security group
certain level network access withing AWS*

lot of noise here

Security work on inbound and outbound room 

Good to get something 

1. Create new security group (DO NOT USE DEFAULT)
2. create EC3
3. EC2 same as server or instance / VM (Same thing) - amazon version of a machine or instance runs - building a virtual computer

Keypair allows you to access your EC2/Server securely

notes:
Keypair connects a user's computer to the AWS EC2 via secure shell
